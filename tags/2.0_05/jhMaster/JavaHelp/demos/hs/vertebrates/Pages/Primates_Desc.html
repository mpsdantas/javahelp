<h1>Primates</h1>
</center>
<p>Humans are part of the primate family. Other common primates include
monkeys, baboons, orangutans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. </p>
<p>Primates have a number of 
distinctive features that separate them from other mammals. Primates have
well developed hands and feet, with fingers and toes. An opposable thumb
makes it easy for them to grab things.
Primates' eyes are forward in the head, giving them stereoscopic vision and enabling them to judge distance. Primates also have large, highly developed
brains. The highly developed visual center of the brain helps primates
distinguish colors. Their intelligence allows them to control and manipulate their
environment. Their large brains also allow them to develop complex
language and communication skills.
</p>
<p> Although primates are born fully formed, they tend
to have  long gestation periods in the womb.
Primate parents also care for and educate their young much longer than do other
animals, resulting in a strong bond between a baby and its mother. Primates
are very social animals and tend to form strong bonds with family and
friends. </p>
<p>While humans, monkeys, and apes are all primates and have many similarities, 
  there are also significant differences. Monkeys and apes walk on all four limbs, 
  but they can run upright using only their hind legs. Humans both run and walk 
  upright on two legs. While apes are known to use simple tools, such as a stick 
  to use for probing for ants and eating them, humans are able to make and use 
  complex tools to help control their environment. Additionally, the human brain 
  is more than twice as large as that of other primates. Humans are the most intelligent 
  primates and have the most developed communication, language, and reasoning 
  skills. However, humans do not have the muscle strength even of the smaller 
  apes.</p>
