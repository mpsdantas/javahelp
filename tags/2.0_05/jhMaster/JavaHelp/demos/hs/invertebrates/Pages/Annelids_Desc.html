<p>Annelids have bodies that are divided into segments. They have very well-developed 
  internal organs. Some have long bristles, and others have shorter bristles and 
  seem smooth, like the earthworms shown below. 
<p>There are about 9,000 species of Annelids known today, including worms
and leeches.
