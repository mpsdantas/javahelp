<h1 align="center">Echinoderms</h1>
<p>Echinoderms are marine animals (animals that live in the ocean). They have arms
or spines that radiate from the center of the body. The central body
contains the organs and the mouth, which is used for feeding.
</p>
<p>Sea stars, commonly known as  starfish, have five or more arms attached
to the body.
</p>
<p>Sea urchins have many spines connected to the body. These spines
help to protect them from predators.
