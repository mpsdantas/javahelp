<p>
Popup windows appear near the location from which they are
activated.  They are not contained in frames and thus
cannot be resized or moved by the user.  Popups are
dismissed by clicking anywhere in the help viewer.
<p>
Popup windows can be activated by clicking on a text object, 
graphic object, or JComponent button.  All three examples are
included in this demo.
