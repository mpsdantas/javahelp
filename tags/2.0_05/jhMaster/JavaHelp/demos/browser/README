There are two .html files:

	AppletViewer.html
and
	AppletViewerAddSwing.html

the first one does not include swingall.jar explicitly, while
the second does.



Browsers
========

Browser's work best when used the Java Plugin.


IE4.0
======

IE4.0 will not support getResource() into resources that are inside
a JAR file in an ARCHIVE tag.  Thus, the current code will NOT correctly
locate a HelpSet that is placed like so.  To make things work, unjar
idehelp.jar into classes.

We will provide a way to address this problem in the FCS release.  Most
likely a HelpSet constructor that takes an InputStream.




AppletViewer
============

These instructions are as of October 20th, 1998.  Using JDK1.2fcs-O
(1.2fcs-RC1) and Swing 1.1beta3.

The HTML package has several bugs related to running under a security manager.
There are:

a. unprivileged calls to getResourceAsStream() to get at the .CSS
   and the .bdtd files
b. more calls to get similar .GIF images for some Icons (like NotFound)
c. calls to System.getProperty() for "awt.image.incrementaldraw" and
   "awt.image.redrawrate"


(1) On JDK1.1.7

Bug (a) does not affect JDK1.1
Bug (b) causes some failures
Bug (c) will cause major problems.

(1a) JDK1.1.7; swingall.jar in CLASSPATH; AppletViewer.html via file:

% setenv CLASSPATH ../../swing/swingall.jar
% appletviewer AppletViewer.html


(1b) JDK1.1.7; swingall.jar in CLASSPATH; AppletViewer.html via http:

% setenv CLASSPATH ../../swing/swingall.jar
% appletviewer http://calterra.eng/calterra.tmp/JH/JavaHelp/demos/browser/AppletViewer.html


(1c) JDK1.1.7; AppletViewerAddSwing.html via file:

% unsetenv CLASSPATH
% appletviewer AppletViewerAddSwing.html

PROBLEMS: (b).  SOME PROBLEMS.  (c) also?


(1d) JDK1.1.7; AppletViewerAddSwing.html via http:

% unsetenv CLASSPATH
% appletviewer http://calterra.eng/calterra.tmp/JH/JavaHelp/demos/browser/AppletViewerAddSwing.html

PROBLEMS: (b) & (c).  EVEN MORE PROBLEMS


(2) On JDK1.2fcs-O

On 1.2, bug (a) makes everything pretty unworkable.  So, you will need
to fix this by modifying the jre/lib/security/java.policy.  Here is what
I've added:

	// added permissions to work around problems in Swing's HTML package

	permission java.io.FilePermission "/export/home2/pelegri/jdk1.2fcs/jre/lib/rt.jar", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "awt.image.incrementaldraw", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "awt.image.redrawrate", "read";
	permission java.awt.AWTPermission "accessEventQueue";

The first one addresses (a) and (c)
The next two address (b)
The last one is to avoid a warning.

(2a) JDK1.2fcs ; AppletViewer.html via file

% unsetenv CLASSPATH
% appletviewer AppletViewer.html

PROBLEMS: this fails because the ../* files are not accessible from the
AppletViewer.  This is a digression from 1.1 functionality.  I don't know
if it will affect our customers.

To run successfully, copy both jhall.jar and idehelp.jar into classes,
then run

% appletviewer AppletViewerPatch.html

(2a) JDK1.2fcs ; AppletViewer.html via file

% unsetenv CLASSPATH
% appletviewer http://calterra.eng/calterra.tmp/JH/JavaHelp/demos/browser/AppletViewer.html

(2c) & (2d) don't apply
