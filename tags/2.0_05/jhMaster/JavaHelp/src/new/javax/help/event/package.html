<code>HelpModelEvent</code> and
<code>HelpModelListener</code> support changes to the
locations within HelpSets being presented,
<code>TextHelpModelEvent</code> and
<code>TextHelpModelListener</code> support textual changes
and <code>HelpSetEvent</code>, and
<code>HelpSetListener</code> support changes to the HelpSet
itself.

<p>
<code>EventListenerList</code> is used as a convenience
class to maintain lists of listeners and it is functionally
equivalent to the equivalent Swing class--it is included to
avoid adding unwanted dependencies on Swing.
