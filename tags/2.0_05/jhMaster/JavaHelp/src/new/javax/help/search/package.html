Supports simple access to search engines.  JavaHelp supports a
standard full-text search view and navigator.  The view interacts
with a search engine through this package.  The reference
implementation provides a search engine that implements these
interfaces, but others can also be used--the specific search engine
is part of the information specified in the search view.  This separation
provides full-text search functionality while not imposing specific
formats.  These details are encapsulated in a search engine type.

<p>
<code>HelpSearch</code> is an abstract base class for the search
engines, <code>SearchQuery</code> obtained from it can be used to
perform the actual queries.  Individual items found by a search are
<code>SearchItem</code>s which can be fired as
<code>HelpEvent</code>s.

<p>
The creation of search databases is done by subclasses of the
abstract class <code>IndexBuilder</code> based on the MIME type of
each document being indexed.  Details of the index building process
can be given through instances of <code>ConfigFile</code>.

<p>
<em>Note:</em> Registration of IndexerKits should probably be visible
in this package.
