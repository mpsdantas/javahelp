These are demos that show the JavaHelp API.

Currently we have two helpsets and three demos.  We need a new
dataset for (context-sensitive) Help on the apidemo.

apidoc/
	HelpSet for API documentation.
	Shows extensibility of JavaHelp
	(Also shows how to use the new doclect interface in javadoc)

holidays/
	HelpSet with a history of the holidays.
	This is most useful to show JavaHelp as navigation of data

idehelp/
	HelpSet with (context-sensitive) help for the mock ide

idedemo/
	Mock-up of an IDE tool.
	Uses apidoc helpset and idehelp.

newdemo/
	Uses holidays.  Shows LAF switching.

browsers/
	Notes & et al. to use activator.
