Start by doing a "gnumake all".  Compile on 1.2fcs-I.  Then:

On 1.1.7 with Swing 1.1b3, the presentation is good.
On 1.2fcs-I, the CSS attributes are wrong but it comes up.
On 1.2fcs-J, the CSS attributes are right, but there is
a problem with the "-target 1.1" on that build.

To use the HelpSet in the JAR:

	sh ../bin/hsviewer Object.hs all.jar

To use the HelpSet from the filesystem:

	sh ../bin/hsviewer hs/Object.hs object.jar

On Win32:

	set JHHOME=<path>\JavaHelp
	..\bin\hsviewer hs/Object.hs object.jar
