<h1 align="center">Insects</h1>
<p>Insects are the largest group of arthropods. There are over 800,000
different types of insects. They are very adaptable, living almost everywhere
in the world. Insects have an exoskeleton that covers the entire body. The body consists of the head, the thorax, and the abdomen.
</p>
<p>The insect's head has a pair of antennae and a pair of compound eyes.
Compound eyes  differ from human eyes. Instead of  a single lens for
each eye, compound eyes have many lenses for each eye. For example, the
fly has about 4,000 lenses in a single eye. These mulitple lenses provide insects with very
good eyesight.
</p>
<p>Extending from the  thorax are legs that the insect uses for walking, swimming, jumping, or digging.
There might also be wings for flying. The abdomen contains important 
organs, including the heart, the respiratory system,
the digestive system, and the reproductive system.
</p>
<p>The insect's hard exoskeleton cannot  grow, making it difficult for the insect's body  to
grow in size. To allow their bodies  to grow, many insects must molt, or shed their exoskeletons. To molt, the insect wriggles out of this old skin,
and then a new, larger exoskeleton develops.
