<h1 align="center">Arachnids</h1>

<p>Arachnids are a type of arthropod. The most commonly known type of arachnid is the spider.
Like other arthropods, arachnids have a hard exoskeleton and jointed
appendages for walking. Unlike other arthropods, arachnids do not have
antennae. Common types of arachnids are spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites.
</p>
<p>Spiders have eight appendages. The first pair is used for holding the
prey and feeding. The second pair can also be used for holding and killing
 prey.The others are used as legs for walking. Most spiders also have
eight eyes. Spiders have fangs they  use to inject poison into  their prey to paralyze or
kill them.
</p>
<p>Many spiders can produce silk threads to spin webs for catching prey
and for building cocoons for their eggs.
</p>
<p>Scorpions are the largest arachnids, some reaching over eight inches in
length. They have six to twelve appendages. They also have a sharp stinger at
the end of the tail, which is used to paralyze or kill insects and small
animals.
</p>
<p>Mites and ticks are small arachnids that are parasites living on the
blood and tissue fluid of other animals. They can occasionally transmit
disease.
