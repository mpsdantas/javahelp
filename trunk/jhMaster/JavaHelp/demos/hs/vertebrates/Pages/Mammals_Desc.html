<center><h1>Mammals</h1></center>
<p>Mammals have several unique characteristics that differentiate them from other 
  types of animals. Most mammals have hair or fur covering their bodies. They 
  are also capable of regulating their body temperature. A mammal's metabolism 
  controls heat production, and sweat glands help cool the body, enabling the 
  mammal to maintain a constant body temperature over a wide range of environmental 
  temperatures. One other difference from other types of animals is that mammals 
  give birth to fully formed babies, and female mammals produce milk to feed their 
  young. 
<p>Most mammals walk on four legs:  only  humans consistently walk upright on
two legs. Aquatic mammals have flippers, or fins, for swimming rather than
legs. Common mammals include primates, such humans and monkeys,
marsupials, rodents, whales, dolphins, and seals.
