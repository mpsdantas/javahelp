<center><h1>Cetaceans</h1></center>
<p>Although they live in the water, whales, dolphins, and porpoises are
mammals. Like other mammals, they cannot breathe underwater, but must come to the surface for air. They breathe through
a blowhole, or nostril, on the top of the head. Babies are born underwater and must be pushed to the surface by the mother so  they can
take their first breath.
</p>
<p>Whales and dolphins also look different from many other mammals because
they don't have fur. However, they do have a sparse covering of hair.
</p>
<p>Their circulatory and respiratory systems have adapted to living in water.
Whales and dolphins can dive deeply on a single breath. Whales
and dolphins also have  highly developed brains and are considered to be
very intelligent.
</p>
<p>All dolphins and some whales can use echolocation to find food and &quot;see&quot;
whatever is around them. They make loud clicking and squeaking sounds that
bounce off objects and echo back to them, enabling  them
to identify  nearby objects and sources of food.
