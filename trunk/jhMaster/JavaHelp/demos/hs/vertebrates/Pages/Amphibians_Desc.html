<center><h1>Amphibians</h1></center>
<p>Amphibians lay their eggs in water. Young amphibians tend to resemble
small fish. The tadpole, or newborn frog, is born and lives in water. It
has a tail that allows it to swim like a fish. It also has gills that
enable it to breathe under water. As the tadpole grows into a frog, it loses its
gills and tail and develops legs for moving around on land. Most amphibians can
both swim in water and walk.
<p>Depending on the species of amphibian, breathing can take place in
the gills, the lungs, the lining of the mouth, the skin, or some combination of
these organs.
<p>An amphibian's body temperature changes with its environment. In cold climates,
amphibians hibernate during the winter.
