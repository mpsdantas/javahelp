<A Name="compression"><h3>Data Compression</h3></A>
<p>
Various data structures within the search database files contain a
sequence of integers. To decrease the overall size of the files a
compression algorithm takes a sequence of integers and produces a
small number (k) and a sequence of bytes. Given k the byte sequence
can be decoded to produce the original integer sequence.
</p>
<p>
The compressed algorithm as follows:

<A NAME="#associdx"><h3>Asociation Index</h3></a>
<p>
Association indexes are a pair of parallel tables: the first table contains
elements; the second table contains offsets of data in an associated file.
The <A HREF="#posidx">Positions Index</A>, <A HREF="#documentsidx">Documents
Index</A>, and <A HREF="#childidx">Childrens Index</A> files are
auxiliary microindex files.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/associndex.jpg" alt="Association Index">
</p>
Externally the files are stored in a compressed form. They use the
data structure described below where the first byte is a compression
factor for the compressed list encoded in following series of
bytes. The number of bytes is a function of the compression factor,
and contents of the list. This is followed by a second pair of compression
factor and bytes for the offset list.
</p>
<p>
The data structure of an auxiliary microindex file is as follows:
</p>
</p>
<p>
<table border=3 cellpadding=5 center=true>
<caption>Auxilary Microindex Data Structure</caption>

<tr>
<th>byte
<td>element list compression factor
</tr>

<tr>
<th>n<sup>1</sup> bytes
<td>compressed elements
</tr>

<tr>
<th>byte
<td>offset list compression factor
</tr>

<tr>
<th>n<sup>1</sup> bytes
<td>compressed offsets
</tr>

</table>
<p>
<sup><b>1</b></sup> The number of bytes is determined by the compression.
</p>

<A NAME="schema"><H3>Schema</H3></A>
The schema file defines keys elements, such as blocksize, root position, free
list of positions and the current number of elements in the various files in the
search database. The schema file is encoded in an XML-based syntax.

<table border=3 cellpadding=5>

<h4>Schema Example</h4>
<p>
The following is an example of a search database schema file:
</p>
<code>
<pre>
&lt;tmap&gt;
	&lt;blocksize&gt;2048&lt;/blocksize&gt;
	&lt;root&gt;4358&lt;/root&gt;
	&lt;empty&gt;-1&lt;/empty&gt;
	&lt;free&gt;-1&lt;/free&gt;
	&lt;next&lt;1026585&lt;/next&gt;
&lt;/tmap&gt;
</pre>
</code>

<p>
In this example the terminology map file has a blocksize of 2048. The root
block is block 4358. There are no empty or free blocks and the next available
block for additions is block 1026585.

<A NAME="tmap"><H3>Terminology Map</H3></A>
<p>
The terminology map is a mapping of concept names to their unique
ids. The name/id pair entries are stored in a btree in a
lexicographical order according to their byte codes. 
</p>
<p>
<h6 align=center>Terminology Map Structure
<p>
<img src="images/btree.jpg" alt="Terminology Map file"></h6>
</p>
<p>
The btree blocks
are stored sequentially in a file. Blocks are either internal or leaf
blocks.  The size of blocks is determined by the
<em>&lt;blocksize&gt;</em> tag in the schema file. By default the
blocksize is 2048.
</p>
<p>
<h6 align=center>Terminology Map File Layout
<p>
<img src="images/btreefile.jpg" alt="Terminology Map file"></h6>
</p>
<p>
The generic terminology map block structure is described in the following table:
</p>
<p>

<table border=3 cellpadding=5 center=true>
<caption> Terminology Map Block Structure</caption>

<tr>
<th>int
<td>block number
</tr>

<tr>
<th>1 bit
<td>leaf = 0<br>internal block = 1
</tr>

<tr>
<th>31 bits
<td>index of first free byte in entries/pointers
</tr>

<tr>
<th>int
<td>number of entries in block 
</tr>

<tr>
<th>n<sup>1</sup> bytes
<td>entries/pointers 
</tr>

</table> 

<sup><b>1</b></sup> n = blocksize - 2*sizeof(int) - 32 bits
</p>

<h4>Leaf blocks</h4>
<p>
A leaf block stores a header followed by a series of lexicographically
ordered entries. If an entry shares a prefix with a preceding entry,
only the remaing suffix of the entry is stored. An entry describes a
concept as specified below.
</p>
<p>
<table border=3 cellpadding=5 center=true>
<caption> Concept Entry Structure</caption>

<tr>
<th>byte
<td>concept (or key) length
</tr>

<tr>
<th>byte
<td>length of the shared prefix
</tr>

<tr>
<th>int
<td>concept ID
</tr>

<tr>
<th>n<sup>1</sup> bytes
<td>concept name (suffix)
</tr>

</table> 
<p>
<sup><b>1</b></sup> n = concept length
</p>
<p>
Compression of concept entries increases the number of concept entries
in a block and reduces the overall file size.  If the first n bytes of
a concept is identical to the prior concept. The matching bytes of the
concept are removed from the concept string and the number of matching
bytes is stored in compressed bytes. Note that the first concept entry
of a block is not compressed.
</p>
<h4>Internal blocks</h4>
<p>
An internal block data differs from the leaf block as it also has a
series of block numbers of its children. Concept entries (described
above) are stored following the block header from the beginning of the
to the middle of the entry/pointer region.  Block numbers are integers
stored in reverse order from the end of entry/pointer region towards
the middle.
</p>
<p>
The first concept entry corresponds to the last block number.  The
block pointed to by the corresponding block number contains entries
that are lexicographically smaller than the concept entry.  In the
Terminolgy Map Structure diagram in block 4, e0 is lexicographically
greater than all the entries in block 5. All of the entries in block 6
are between e0 and e1 and all of the entries in block 7 are greater
than e1.
</p>
<A NAME="positions"><h3>Positions</h3> 
<p>
The Positions file is a collection of microindexes. Microindexes are
independent of one another and are stored one after another. There is
one microindex per indexed document.
</p>
<h6 align=center>Positions Data Structures
<p>
<img src="images/positions.jpg"></h6>
<A NAME=posidx><H4>Position Index</H4></A>
<p>
The Positions Index is an <A HREF="associdx">association index</A> of
document ids and corresponding offsets of microindexes in the Positions
file.
</p>
<A NAME="microidx"><h4>Microindex</h4></A>
<p>
A microindex is fundamental unit of index.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of microindexes: Single Group Index, Multiple Group Index.
<p>
Concept ids and positions are stored in concept groups of no more than
16 concepts.  The first two bits of a microindex determines the
type of group according to the table below:
</p>
<p>
<table border=3 cellpadding=5>

<tr>
<th>00
<td>Single Index. 16 or less concepts.
</tr>

<tr>
<th>10
<td>Multiple Indexes. 17 or more concepts.
</tr>
</table>

<H5>Single Index</H5> A single index concept group contains 16 or less
concepts. Usage of a single index in JavaHelp is unlikely. It is
provided to support other technologies uses of the search engine. An
example use would be the storing of subject lines in Mail. 
</p>
<h6 align=center>Single Group Index Structure
<p>
<img src="images/singleindex.jpg"></h6>
<p>
In the above diagram, the C/P group contains two compressed lists. The
first, with a compression factor of K<sub>1</sub>, is a list of at
most 16 concept ids in ascending order. The second, with a compression
factor of K<sub>2</sub>, is a list of pairs of positions and 4 bit
indexes into the first list.  Positions (offsets) are stored in
ascending numerical order.The C/P group is on a byte boundary, but
there is no byte boundary between the two compressed lists.
</p>
<p>
<table border=3 cellpadding=5>
<caption> Single Index - Concept Group Data Structure</caption>

<tr>
<th>3 bits

<tr>
<th>29 bits

<tr>
<th>byte

<tr>
<th>n<sup>1</sup> bytes

A compressed list of positions.<br>
Each positions is followed by 4 bit number
identifying concept in this group.
</tr>

</table> 
<p>
<sup><b>1</b></sup> The number of bytes is determined by the compression.
</p>

<h5>Multiple Index</h5> A multiple index contains 17 or more
concepts. Concept ids and positions are stored in concept groups of at
most 16 concepts. Concept ids are sorted in ascending id order and
then cut into groups.
</p>
<h6 align=center>Multiple Group Index Structure
<p>
<img src="images/multipleindex.jpg"></h6>
<p>
In the above diagram, the Index structure describes the actual data
structure memory layout. The first byte contains the compression
factor (KK) for the following compressed KTable. The KTable, LenTable,
and MaxTable immediately follow the compression factor (KK) without
byte boundaries. These are then followed by consecutive C/P groups on 
byte boundaries.
</p>
<p>
The contents of the KTable are pairs of compression factors for C/P
groups. The last two entries in the table are the compression factors
for the LenTable and MaxTable. The LenTable is a list of lengths for
the first n-1 C/P groups. The MaxTable is a list of maximal concept id
for the first n-1 C/P groups. 
</p>
<p>
The C/P group contains two compressed lists. The first, with a
compression factor of K<sub>1</sub> from the KTable, is a list of 15
concept ids in ascending order for the first n-1 groups. The 16
concept id for the first n-1 C/P groups is stored in the MaxTable. The
last C/P group stores 16 or less concepts in ascending order.  The
second list in each C/P group, with a compression factor of
K<sub>2</sub> from the KTable, is a list of pairs of positions and 4
bit indexes into the first list. Positions (offsets) are stored in
ascending numerical order. The C/P group is on a byte boundary, but
there is no byte boundary between the two compressed lists.
